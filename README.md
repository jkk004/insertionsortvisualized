# Insertion Sort Visualized
The first time I saw a sorting problem on Leetcode, my instinctual way of solving the problem was with Insertion Sort. Of course, this was not the fastest way to solve the problem, but I still felt inspired for coming up a sorting method when faced with this problem. Due to this, I felt obligated to make a visualization of Insertion Sort on Python.
