# Insertion Sort Visualized
The first time I saw a sorting problem on Leetcode, my instinctual way of solving the problem was with Insertion Sort. Of course, this was not the fastest way to solve the problem, but it was the sorting method I thought of when faced with this problem. Due to this, I feel obligated to make a visualization of Insertion Sort on Python.
